== Description ==

WParty is a WordPress Plugin to mix website contents  
* Pages  
* Articles  
* Widgets  
* Menus  
* Media  

* Simply use the shortcode [part]
* [part name="page-name"]

* Coming soon: Theme Builder  

NOTE: The plugin also activates ALL shortcodes in Text Widgets.
It makes easier to write HTML content in WordPress Editor, using Pages, and then embed the content in Text Widgets.

Custom HTML styles attributes can be added (id, class, style).

* [part name="page-name" id="my-id" class="my-class" style="background-color:#123456;"]

* Manage easily Events or Multi-languages websites

* REDIRECT
* [part widget="redirect" instance="/url2/"]

* CONDITIONS 
* [part name="page-name" start="01-03-2013" end="25-03-2013"]  
* [part if="lang=fr" widget="redirect" instance="/url2/"]  

Custom Menus can also be included.
* [part menu="my-menu" name="page-name"]  

* Default LOOP can be included same as a widget:
