== Description ==

WParty is a WordPress plugin to mix pages/articles/media/menus content.

// shortcode [part name="page-name"]

// shortcode [part name="page-name" id="my-id" class="my-class" style="background-color:#123456;"]

Widgets can be added inside Pages/Posts. (Calendar, Recent_Posts, Tags).

Content can embed recursive shortcodes.

Custom Menus can also be included.
